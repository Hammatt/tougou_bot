# Tougou\_Bot

A basic discord bot, re-written in GO.

This branch focuses on re-writing tougou in GO.  
There are a few things that I hope to achieve while doing this:  
1. Greatly increase the ammount of automated tests.
2. Greatly improve code quality. (things like code re-use etc.)
3. Improve reliability.
4. Switch to a docker based deployment strategy.
5. Make it easier to build in move features.
6. Improve doccumentation.
7. Improve my use of the Japanese Language.

Note: I know that I could achieve all of these things staying with Exlir, but I
 didn't wind up enjoying Elixir as much as originally thought. 
I always enjoy learning new languages, it's one of my favorite things & I've been
 looking for an excuse to learn GO for a while.
